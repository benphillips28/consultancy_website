    <p>Our work spans three key areas:</p>
    <p>üåø <b>Ecological Systems</b> - We conduct ecological surveys, field experiments, GIS mapping and analysis, 
      and evidence reviews to inform conservation from urban greenspaces and farmland to forests and oceans.</p>
    <p>üîç <b>People & Nature</b> - We explore how people engage with nature - their attitudes, values and behaviours - 
      using surveys, interviews and digital data to help shape more effective and inclusive conservation strategies.</p>
    <p>üõ†Ô∏è <b>Consultancy & Data Services</b> ‚Äì We offer grant writing support, general environmental consultancy, 
      and data management and analysis services to organisations seeking clear, evidence-based insights.</p>
