    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At Apex Science & Conservation, we provide organisations with scientific support and produce nature conservation research that is both rigorous and directly relevant to real-world decisions.</p>
    <p>We provide our time and expertise to NGOs, government agencies, and research institutions, allowing them to carry out projects that they may otherwise not be able.</p>
    <p>We offer a wide range of services across three key areas:</p>
    <p>üåø <b>Ecological Systems</b> - Conducting ecological surveys, field experiments, GIS analysis, and evidence reviews to inform conservation across landscapes - from urban greenspaces to farmland to forests to oceans.</p>
    <p>üîç <b>People & Nature</b> - Exploring how people engage with nature - their attitudes, values and behaviours - using surveys, interviews and digital data to help shape more effective and inclusive conservation strategies.</p>
    <p>XX <b>General Science Consultancy</b> - General consultancy, grant writing services, and data analysis.</p>
    <p>See the Services tab for further details of how we can help you.</p>
