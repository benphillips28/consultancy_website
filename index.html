    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Apex helps organisations achieve their sustainability goals through practical, clear, and effective environmental consultancy. We believe in actionable strategies that drive measurable impact for your business and the planet.</p>
    <p>We partner with NGOs, government agencies, and research institutions to co-produce research that is both scientifically rigorous and directly relevant to real-world decisions.</p>
    <p>We work across two key areas:</p>
    <p>üåø <b>Ecological Systems</b> - Conducting ecological surveys, field experiments, GIS analysis, and evidence reviews to inform conservation across landscapes - from urban greenspaces to farmland to forests to oceans.</p>
    <p>üîç <b>People & Nature</b> - Exploring how people engage with nature - their attitudes, values and behaviours - using surveys, interviews and digital data to help shape more effective and inclusive conservation strategies.</p>
